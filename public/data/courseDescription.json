        "overview": "It is a myth that only smart and hardworking people can be successful. While intelligence is important to success, it is by no means the be-all and end-all to success. A growing body of research suggests that emotional intelligence, measured by emotional quotient (EQ), is a better predictor of “success” than the more traditional measures of cognitive intelligence (IQ). Emotional Intelligence is not about being soft, emotional and \"nice\". Rather, it is about being effective, and knowing how to communicate and work effectively. Emotional Intelligence reflects one's ability to deal with daily challenges and it also includes internal skills necessary to manage and control oneself in different situations.Utilising BarOn EQ-I, a globally leading EQ assessment tool, you will discover your EQ level and see first-hand how important it is. Using the EQ framework, you will also learn to evaluate strategies for talent management, organisational performance and individual development.Special FeaturesEQ assessments will be done online prior to the workshop. Your individual EQ score and development report will be given to you during the course to help you learn more about your EQ profiles.The Bar On EQ-i is the globally leading tool for assessing Emotional Intelligence. It has been used by over 100,000 people throughout the world. The test is based on over 20 years of research and has been independently validated by numerous research studies at leading Universities. The tool is used by many major companies and government organisations around the world including IBM, American Express, and the Canadian and US Governments.ObjectivesBy the end of this course, you will be able to:Understand the importance of Emotional Intelligence (EQ) inorganisationsKnow your own EQ profile using a leading EQ assessment tool, available only to certified usersCreate a personal EQ development strategy based on your own EQ profile",

That is the value of scenarios: sketching for us the terrain within which we have room to manoeuvre.Scenarios are a complement to quantitative models to forecast the future, because they analyse qualitative factors that drive change, such as shifts in values and interests, which are not easily captured by quantitative models. Scenarios can spark “strategic conversations” on possible futures, and allow the discussion of questions that may be otherwise uncomfortable to discuss.This two-day course is intended for agencies planning to undertake a full-scale scenario project. You will be taught the full methodology of scenario planning.Learning Outcomes:Define the local question;Identify and analyse driving forces;Construct scenario frameworksArticulate and communicate the scenario stories; andTranslate scenarios to strategies.This workshop provides a much more in-depth and hands-on experience of scenario planning than FutureCraft 101, though this course builds upon the basics taught in that course.

This will enable you to integrate less familiar aspects of your leadership power with the capabilities you already use. You will also gain clarity on what drives you and learn how to stay committed to that even under pressure, and explore ways in which you can better engage and inspire your team(s) to achieve your agency’s objectives.ObjectivesBy the end of this programme, you will be able to:Maintain your presence to lead effectively and gain trust and respect as a leaderAdapt your responses under pressure so as to respond with greater clarity and confidenceHold courageous conversations about important issuesEmbody authenticity, integrity, trust, consistency and confidence",

Thus, our success in life and work is very much dependent on how well we manage such systems. Unfortunately, many of us are unable to deal effectively with systems. Very often, our attempts at improving our lives and work simply end up making things worse.  Or, the system resists our best efforts and does not change at all.  Naturally, we end up feeling frustrated, puzzled and even helpless.The reason for this limited success in dealing with human systems lies in the difficulty in seeing the connections that exist among its various components (i.e. the stakeholders within the system).  When we fail to see such connections, our well-intentioned actions often create unintended consequences.  Systems Thinking, is a set of simple tools to help us see these connections better and create more effective strategies for both our lives and work. This requires us to answer The 3 Questions That Systems Thinkers Ask (or 3QueST™ for short).  In this programme, several tools, which are also part of the 3QueST™ methodology, are introduced to address these 3 questions.  There will be opportunities to practice using the tools on issues or challenges you are facing in your work or personal life.ObjectivesBy the end of the programme, you will be able to:Know the 3 questions that System Thinkers ask (3QueST™)Identify leverage within the system to get the results we wantCreate strategies that can be sustained over time, and grow the results we want by creating a Success LoopAnticipate and deal with unintended consequences using the TFD toolIdentify and deal with the causes of resistance using the MARS framework",

While some of these initiatives have found success, there are likely many others that have not. This can be attributed to the lack of attention paid to securing acceptance of change by affected stakeholders.What can we do as OD practitioners to improve the effectiveness of the change initiatives? How should we structure the management of these initiatives for success? What systematic approaches can we adopt to manage the human side of change? What can we do to foster the acceptance of change by the affected stakeholders?Programme MethodologyThis 3 day programme is designed to be practice-oriented and includes a simulation experience that facilitates learning transfer. You should come with your team member(s) as an intact change team and bring with you a real change management project that you are currently working on. This will allow you to apply Prosci’s research based Change Management Methodology.The Prosci® change management methodology has been developed through research and extensive benchmarking of change management practices worldwide. The methodology involves three steps: preparing for change, managing change and reinforcing change – all of which are scalable and flexible components that you can tailor and apply to your specific organisational needs.ObjectivesBy the end of the programme, you will be able to:Build the business case for effective change management in your organisation.Develop a change management strategy and plan for your project.Apply the ADKAR™ Model in helping managers and supervisors effectively manage the people side of change.Apply Prosci’s® change management methodology, tools and templates to an actual project from your organisation.[Note: You will be certified in Prosci’s® Change Management Methodology and will also be able to lead your organisation through both incremental and radical changes.] ",

Without EQ, a person can have the best training in the world, an incisive, analytical mind, and an endless supply of smart ideas, but he still won’t make a great leader. (Daniel Goleman, “What Makes a Leader”, HBR, 1998)Research shows that a high level of emotional intelligence (EQ) is associated with better performance in areas such as self-awareness, decision-making and developing relationships with others. As a manager, you are expected to work with and through team members, peers and stakeholders to achieve results. When perspectives differ, emotions show up, impacting the people you work with as well as your own work performance. How aware are you of your emotions and their impact on your behaviour and others around you? How do you strengthen your impact, presence and interpersonal connections through the use of emotional intelligence?Specially designed for managers, this programme will help you leverage your emotional intelligence to be a more effective team leader.ObjectivesBy the end of this programme, you will be able to:Recognise the role of EQ in leadershipDevelop EQ behaviours and practices at work to better lead your officers through the understanding of EQ competencies, tools and knowledgeIncrease your emotional self-awareness and understandingAcquire skills to develop resilience and greater capacity for leadershipDevelop interpersonal competencies to understand, interact and relate well with others in an emotionally intelligent wayIdentify your current EQ strengths and areas of development based on the EQ-Assessment for Leaders (EQ-i 2.0) and relate the findings to your leadership context to enhance your effectiveness as a managerDevelop a personal action plan to enhance your leadership impact and presence",

At the workplace, you motivate your colleagues and help them to manage change, train and develop them with the right knowledge, skills, mind-sets and instincts to respond to the public confidently. The Human Resource Managers Programme (HRMP) will provide you the perspectives, networks and knowledge to achieve these.Targeted at experienced HR middle management, this seven-day milestone programme will introduce you to strategic HR concepts. It will also equip you with the tools and knowledge on how you can support your HR leader, work with management and manage line departments effectively. In addition, you will have the opportunity to apply what you have learned through an individual project with a chosen topic of significance to you and your organisation.
